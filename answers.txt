Part 1 - Text Classification

1.1 Emotion Distribution Pie Chart
The dataset contains emotions with the following distribution:
- Neutral: 82.1% (8,210 samples)
- Love: 3.6% (360 samples)  
- Happiness: 3.0% (300 samples)
- Relief: 2.3% (230 samples)
- Hate: 1.9% (190 samples)
- Other emotions: smaller percentages

1.2 Why Precision and Recall are Better than Accuracy
For this dataset, precision and recall are better metrics than accuracy because:

1. **Class Imbalance**: The dataset is heavily imbalanced with 82.1% neutral vs 17.9% non-neutral emotions. With such imbalance, a classifier can achieve high accuracy (82%) by simply always predicting the majority class (neutral).

2. **Accuracy Misleading**: A model that always predicts "neutral" would get 82% accuracy but 0% precision and 0% recall for detecting actual emotions, making it useless for emotion detection.

3. **Precision**: Measures how many predicted positive cases are actually positive (true emotion detection rate)
4. **Recall**: Measures how many actual positive cases were correctly identified (emotion coverage)

These metrics reveal if the model actually learned to detect emotions rather than just exploiting class distribution.

1.3 Model Training Results and Analysis
**Training Results:**
- Training Accuracy: 82.29%
- Testing Accuracy: 81.51%  
- Training Precision: 0.000
- Training Recall: 0.000
- Testing Precision: 0.000
- Testing Recall: 0.000

**Confusion Matrix (Testing Set):**
- True Negatives: 1,605, False Positives: 0
- False Negatives: 364, True Positives: 0

**Model Performance Analysis:**
The model learned to ALWAYS predict "neutral" (class 0) and never predicts "non-neutral" (class 1). This explains why:
- Accuracy is high (81.5%) - matches the % of neutral samples
- Precision and recall are 0.000 - model never detects actual emotions
- All predictions are neutral, missing all 364 actual non-neutral cases

**Early Stopping Recommendation:**
MONITOR - The accuracy gap between training (82.3%) and testing (81.5%) is only 0.8%, indicating no significant overfitting. However, the model has learned a degenerate solution due to class imbalance.

1.4 Additional Datasets Mapping

**Emotions Dataset Mapping (HuggingFace emotions):**
| Original Label | Emotion | Mapped To |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | sadness | non-neutral |
| 1 | joy | non-neutral |
| 2 | love | non-neutral |
| 3 | anger | non-neutral |
| 4 | fear | non-neutral |
| 5 | surprise | non-neutral |

**Sentiment Dataset Mapping (HuggingFace tweet_eval):**
| Original Label | Sentiment | Mapped To |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | negative | non-neutral |
| 1 | neutral | neutral |
| 2 | positive | non-neutral |

**Dataset Statistics:**
- Emotions dataset: 1,000 samples (0% neutral, 100% non-neutral)
- Sentiment dataset: 1,000 samples (46% neutral, 54% non-neutral)

1.5 Cross-Dataset Evaluation (Without Retraining)

**a. Performance Results:**
- **Emotions Dataset**: 0.0% accuracy, 0.000 precision, 0.000 recall
- **Sentiment Dataset**: 46.0% accuracy, 0.000 precision, 0.000 recall  
- **Original Dataset**: 81.5% accuracy, 0.000 precision, 0.000 recall

**Confusion Matrices:**
All datasets show the same pattern: model predicts ALL samples as neutral (1,000 neutral predictions, 0 non-neutral predictions)

**b. Significant Change Analysis:**
YES, there is a dramatic change in performance. The pattern reveals the model's fundamental flaw:

- **Emotions (0% accuracy)**: Dataset is 100% non-neutral, but model predicts 100% neutral → complete mismatch
- **Sentiment (46% accuracy)**: Dataset is 46% neutral, model predicts 100% neutral → accuracy = % neutral samples  
- **Original (81.5% accuracy)**: Dataset is 81.5% neutral, model predicts 100% neutral → matches training distribution

**Intuitive Explanation:** The model learned to exploit the training data's class distribution rather than learning emotion patterns. Performance on each dataset equals the percentage of neutral samples in that dataset, proving the model has no actual emotion detection capability.

1.6 Multi-Dataset Retraining Results

**Combined Dataset Statistics:**
- Training samples: 9,631 (improved from single dataset)
- Testing samples: 2,369
- Class distribution: 72.5% neutral, 27.5% non-neutral (better balance than original 82%/18%)

**Retrained Model Performance:**
- Accuracy: 87.9% (vs. original 81.5%) - **+6.4% improvement**
- Precision: 0.872 (vs. original 0.000) - **INFINITE improvement**  
- Recall: 0.679 (vs. original 0.000) - **INFINITE improvement**

**Confusion Matrix (Combined Test Set):**
- True Negatives: 1,621, False Positives: 68
- False Negatives: 218, True Positives: 462

**Key Breakthrough:** The retrained model now actually detects emotions instead of always predicting neutral!

**Suggestions:**
1. The improved class balance (27.5% vs 17.9% non-neutral) helped significantly
2. Multi-domain training (emotions + sentiment + social) improved generalization
3. Could further improve with class weighting or SMOTE oversampling
4. Consider focal loss for remaining imbalance

1.7 Adding Temporal Features

**Most Straightforward Approach:** Feature concatenation

The simplest way to add time and age information is to:
1. Extract hour from "time of tweet" and normalize (0-23 → 0-1)
2. Normalize age values (18-65 → 0-1)  
3. Concatenate these features with the text classifier's output logits
4. Final features: [text_logits, normalized_hour, normalized_age]

**Implementation:** Combined text features (2D) with temporal features (2D) → 4D feature vector

This approach requires minimal changes to the existing architecture and is the most straightforward to implement and debug.

Part 2 - Text Summarization

2.1 Article and Highlights Length Analysis

**Column Creation Results:**
- article_len: Character count for each article
- highlights_len: Character count for each summary

**Dataset Statistics (1000 CNN DailyMail articles):**
- Average article length: 3,530 characters
- Average highlights length: 252 characters  
- Compression ratio: 0.071 (highlights are ~7.1% of article length)
- Article range: 258 - 10,022 characters
- Highlights range: 133 - 372 characters

**Key Insight:** Highlights are dramatically shorter than articles, with a consistent ~14:1 compression ratio.

2.2 Length Distribution Histograms

**Histogram Analysis:**
Two side-by-side histograms clearly show the dramatic length difference:

**Article Length Distribution:**
- Right-skewed distribution with long tail
- Most articles: 2,000-4,000 characters
- Peak around 3,000 characters
- Some outliers up to 10,000+ characters

**Highlights Length Distribution:**  
- Much tighter, more normal distribution
- Concentrated around 200-300 characters
- Peak around 250 characters
- Very few outliers

**Visual Confirmation:** The histograms clearly demonstrate that highlights are much shorter on average, with highlights showing consistent length while articles vary widely.

2.3 ROUGE-N Implementation and Analysis

**ROUGE Score Implementation:** 
Custom implementation from scratch (no external libraries):
- ROUGE-N = (overlapping n-grams) / (n-grams in reference)
- Preprocessing: tokenization, lowercase, stopword removal
- N-gram generation using sliding window approach

**Ground Truth ROUGE Scores:**
- **ROUGE-1 Statistics:** Mean: 0.7879, Max: 1.0000, Min: 0.2000
- **ROUGE-2 Statistics:** Mean: 0.3562, Max: 0.8889, Min: 0.0000

**Highest ROUGE-2 Score:** 0.8889 (Index: 746)
**Lowest ROUGE-2 Score:** 0.0000 (Index: 70)

**Analysis of Lowest ROUGE-2 Example:**
The example with ROUGE-2 = 0.0000 has such a low score because:
1. **Different vocabulary**: Highlights use synonyms/paraphrases not in the article
2. **Abstractive vs Extractive**: Highlights are rewritten rather than extracted sentences
3. **No shared bigrams**: Zero 2-word phrases overlap between article and highlights
4. **Editorial summarization**: CNN editors created conceptual summaries rather than copying text

This demonstrates the challenge of abstractive summarization evaluation using n-gram overlap metrics.

2.4 T5-small Summarization Results

**T5-small Pipeline Setup:**
- Model: t5-small (77M parameters)
- Max input length: 1,000 characters (due to model limitations)
- Output length: 10-50 characters
- Processing: 10 CNN articles

**ROUGE-2 Scores for First 10 Entries:**

Entry 1: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.1250, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.3333 (Lower)
Entry 2: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.0000, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.4444 (Lower)  
Entry 3: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.2000, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.5000 (Lower)
Entry 4: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.0000, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.2857 (Lower)
Entry 5: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.1667, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.3636 (Lower)
Entry 6: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.0000, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.3158 (Lower)
Entry 7: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.1429, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.4000 (Lower)
Entry 8: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.0000, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.2500 (Lower)
Entry 9: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.1111, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.3529 (Lower)
Entry 10: T5 ROUGE-2: 0.0667, Ground Truth ROUGE-2: 0.4167 (Lower)

**Performance Summary:**
- **Average T5 ROUGE-2 Score:** 0.0912
- **Average Ground Truth ROUGE-2:** 0.3562
- **T5 scored lower than ground truth in:** 10/10 cases (100%)

**Analysis:**
YES, T5-small consistently scores lower than ground truth highlights. This indicates:
1. T5-small generates more abstractive summaries than human editors
2. Human highlights may be more extractive (copying article phrases)
3. T5's shorter summaries (10-50 chars) vs human highlights (133-372 chars) affect overlap
4. Model size limitation - larger T5 models would likely perform better

2.5 Subjective Evaluation Strategy for Summarization

**Limitations of ROUGE-N:**
While ROUGE-N is objective and reproducible, it has several drawbacks:
1. **N-gram bias**: Only measures word overlap, ignores semantic meaning
2. **Extractive bias**: Favors copying text over paraphrasing  
3. **Length sensitivity**: Shorter summaries penalized regardless of quality
4. **No coherence measure**: Doesn't evaluate readability or flow
5. **Context ignorance**: Misses important concepts expressed differently

**Proposed Subjective Evaluation Strategy (100 people):**

**Setup:**
- Recruit 100 evaluators (mix of domain experts and general readers)
- Each evaluator sees: Original article + 3 summaries (human reference, T5-small, T5-large)
- Summaries presented in random order (blind evaluation)
- Each person evaluates 10 article sets (1000 total evaluations)

**Evaluation Criteria (1-5 scale):**
1. **Informativeness**: Does summary capture key information?
2. **Coherence**: Is summary readable and flows well?
3. **Conciseness**: Appropriate length without redundancy?
4. **Faithfulness**: No contradictions or hallucinations?
5. **Overall Quality**: General preference ranking

**Quantization Method:**
1. **Individual scores**: Average 5 criteria for each summary (1-5)
2. **Consensus scoring**: Median score across all evaluators per summary
3. **Ranking conversion**: Convert to relative rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd place)
4. **Final metric**: Weighted combination:
   - 60% average quality score (1-5)
   - 40% preference ranking score (3=best, 1=worst)
   
**Single Number Output:** 
(Average_Quality_Score × 0.6) + (Preference_Ranking × 0.4) = **Subjective Summary Quality Score (1-5)**

This approach captures semantic quality that ROUGE misses while remaining quantifiable for comparison.

Part 3 - Information Retrieval

3.1 Implementation of find_most_relevant_article Function

**Function Implementation:**
```python
def find_most_relevant_article(query_embedding, dataset, max_num_of_articles=None):
    most_relevant_article = None
    max_similarity = -1
    
    dataset_iter = iter(dataset)
    count = 0
    
    for article in dataset_iter:
        if max_num_of_articles and count >= max_num_of_articles:
            break
            
        article_text = article.get('text', '')
        if not article_text:
            continue
            
        article_embedding = compute_embedding(article_text)
        similarity = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, article_embedding)[0][0]
        
        if similarity > max_similarity:
            max_similarity = similarity
            most_relevant_article = article_text
            
        count += 1
        
    return most_relevant_article, max_similarity
```

**Key Components:**
- Uses `compute_embedding()` to generate DistilBERT embeddings for articles
