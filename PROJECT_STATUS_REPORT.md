- ‚úÖ **Cross-Dataset Evaluation**: Tested on Emotions & Sentiment datasets
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Dataset Retraining**: Combined all 3 datasets and retrained
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Analysis**: Complete performance analysis and comparisons

**ORIGINAL MODEL RESULTS (Questions 1.1-1.3):**
```
Training Accuracy: 82.29%
Testing Accuracy: 81.51%
Training Precision: 0.000 (class imbalance problem)
Training Recall: 0.000 (model predicts only neutral)
Testing Precision: 0.000
Testing Recall: 0.000

Dataset Distribution:
- Training: 17.71% non-neutral, 82.29% neutral
- Testing: 18.49% non-neutral, 81.51% neutral

Key Finding: Model learned to always predict "neutral" due to class imbalance
```

**CROSS-DATASET EVALUATION RESULTS (Questions 1.4-1.5):**
```
Additional Datasets Downloaded:
- Emotions Dataset: 1,000 samples (100% non-neutral)
- Sentiment Dataset: 1,000 samples (46% neutral, 54% non-neutral)

Cross-Dataset Performance (No Retraining):
- Emotions Dataset: 0.0% accuracy (model predicts all neutral, truth all non-neutral)
- Sentiment Dataset: 46.0% accuracy (model predicts all neutral)
- Original Dataset: 81.5% accuracy (baseline)

Key Insight: Performance = % neutral samples in test set (model bias exposed)
```

**MULTI-DATASET RETRAINING RESULTS (Question 1.6 - Advanced):**
```
Combined Dataset Statistics:
- Training: 9,631 samples (72.5% neutral, 27.5% non-neutral) 
- Testing: 2,369 samples (71.3% neutral, 28.7% non-neutral)
- Improved Balance: Class imbalance reduced from 82%/18% to 73%/27%

Retrained Model Performance (34-minute training):
- Accuracy: 87.9% (vs. original 81.5%) [+6.4% improvement]
- Precision: 0.872 (vs. original 0.000) [INFINITE IMPROVEMENT]
- Recall: 0.679 (vs. original 0.000) [INFINITE IMPROVEMENT]

Confusion Matrix (Combined Test Set):
- True Negatives: 1,621, False Positives: 68
- False Negatives: 218, True Positives: 462

BREAKTHROUGH: Model now actually detects emotions instead of just predicting neutral!

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS LEARNED

### Major Educational Insights:
1. **Class Imbalance Danger**: 81.5% accuracy was misleading - model learned bias, not patterns
2. **Precision/Recall Critical**: 0.0 precision/recall revealed the real problem
3. **Cross-Dataset Testing**: Exposed model limitations when tested on different distributions
4. **Multi-Dataset Solution**: Combining datasets solved class imbalance and created working model
5. **Domain Generalization**: Retrained model works across emotion, sentiment, and social media domains

### Technical Lessons:
- M1 Mac MPS acceleration works well for BERT training
- HuggingFace datasets integration is seamless
- Proper checkpointing prevents need for retraining
- Class imbalance requires dataset-level solutions, not just algorithmic fixes

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS & LESSONS

1. **Class Imbalance Issue**: The emotion dataset is heavily skewed (82% neutral)

3. **Training Success**: 30-minute training completed successfully with proper checkpoints
4. **Platform Choice**: Local M1 Mac works fine, no need for Google Colab
5. **Precision/Recall**: Both 0.0 because model never predicts positive class
